# SPM Items but Good
This mod makes it so if there are no enemies on screen when you use an attacking item, it doesn't delete the item from your inventory.
I speedran the making of this mod during chefnick's run, for an end time of 58:03.82.

The main timeloss comes from not understanding that the function called itemdrv::itemDelete does not delete the item from your inventory, but rather deletes the icon of the item on screen. Still got sub hour tho

also it only works on PAL because I have nothing but pure hatred for my fellow man (but mostly because porting is hard :sob:)
